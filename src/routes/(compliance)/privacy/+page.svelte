    <h2>TL;DR</h2>
    Whenplane doesn't collect much, and what it does collect will not be shared other than aggregate stats.<br>
    <br>
    For example, the data may be used to figure out how many unique users used the site in a given time period.
    This number of unique users may be shared.<br>
    The data that lead to the calculation of those numbers will not be shared outside of the place they are stored for any reason.<br>
    <br>
    The only potentially sensitive information that Whenplane saves is your User Agent, which may describe what browser and operating system you are using.<br>
